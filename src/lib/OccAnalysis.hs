-- === External API ===

-- This annotates every `Let` binding in the given `Block` with an `OccInfo`
-- annotation holding a summary of how that binding is used.  It also eliminates
-- unused pure bindings as it goes, since it has all the needed information.

analyzeOccurrences = liftLamExpr analyzeOccurrencesBlock
{-# INLINE analyzeOccurrences #-}

analyzeOccurrencesBlock = liftOCCM . occ accessOnce
{-# SCC analyzeOccurrencesBlock #-}

-- === Overview ===

-- We analyze every binding in the program for occurrence information,
-- namely information on how much it is used.
--
-- If a (pure) binding is not used at all, we take the opportunity to
-- eliminate it.  Otherwise, we track both static and dynamic usage
-- information:
-- - If a binding is used statically at most once, then inlining it
--   does not increase code size
-- - If a binding is used dynamically at most once, then inlining it
--   does not increase runtime work
--
-- The static usage information is just an Int counting the number of
-- static uses.  The dynamic usage information is an
-- Occ.DynUseInfo, counting an upper bound on the number of
-- dynamic uses, and keeping track of how many dimensions of indexing
-- have to be apparent for inlining to be work-preserving.  (For
-- example, if the usage is `for i. xs.i`, in order to inline `xs`
-- safely, we need to have access to the `for` expression that
-- constructed it so as to cancel against the indexing expression.)

-- === Data Structure ===

-- Our primary operating structure is a map (potentially partial) from names to
-- their current Occ.AccessInfo information.

-- Close every AccessInfo in the given FV by abstracting over the given binder
-- with `Occ.ForEach`, i.e., because it's the binder of a `for`.
-- We internally sink back under the binder because we are not (yet) removing
-- the entry for the binder itself, and the type of NameMapE cannot represent a
-- map from names in `l` to E-kinded things with names in `n` (though maybe it
-- should be changed?)

-- === Monad ===

-- We carry the above FV data structure, which is accumulated bottom up; and
-- also an environment accumulated top down that gives, for each name we have
-- encountered, an `IxExpr` summarizing what indexing by that name might mean,
-- should such indexing occur in that name's scope.
--
-- These `IxExpr`s are in terms of
-- - Binders already in scope when the analysis begins (e.g., the top-level
--   environment), and
-- - Binders introduced by `for`
