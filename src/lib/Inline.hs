      -- A subtlety from the Secrets paper.  In Haskell, it is feasible to have
      -- a binding whose occurrence information indicates multiple uses, but
      -- which does a small, bounded amount of runtime work.  GHC will inline
      -- such a binding, but not into contexts where GHC knows that no further

      -- Inlining f here is useless because it's not applied, and mildly costly
      -- because it causes the closure to be allocated at every call to g rather
      -- than just once.
      -- TODO If we want to track this subtlety, we should make room for it in
      -- the SizePreservationInfo ADT (maybe rename it), maybe with a
      -- OnceButDuplicatesBoundedWork constructor.  Then only the true UsedOnce

    --   writing, the inliner does not remove effects, and (ii) even if it did,
    --   we could recover the end state by running another inlining pass.

    --   xs = for i.
    --     ys = for j. <something>
    --     for k. ys.k
    -- really does have two available indexing levels, because the ys binding is
    -- inlinable into the result of the outer `for`; but the below function will
    -- not detect it, and thus we will decline to inline `xs` into a context
    -- where two levels of indexing are required.  However, we can recover the
    -- desired effect by running a second pass of occurrence analysis and
    -- inlining.

    --   xs = for i.
    --     ys = for j. <something>

    -- a context that required two levels of indexing, we would temporarily
    -- duplicate work, but a second pass of occurence analysis and inlining
    -- would fix it by inlining `ys`.  However, if we decline to inline here,
    -- running inlining on the body of `for i.` will not inline into the `view`,
    -- because in general views are supposed to be duplicable all over.  Maybe
    -- the solution is to just not have view atoms in the IR by this point,
    -- since their main purpose is to force inlining in the simplifier, and if
    -- one just stuck like this it has become equivalent to a `for` anyway.
