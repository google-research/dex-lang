-- Start watching and evaluating the given file.  Returns a channel on
-- which one can subscribe to updates to the evaluation state.
--
-- The overall system looks like this:
-- - `forkWatchFile` creates an actor that watches the file for
--   changes and sends `FileChanged` messages to the driver.
-- - `runDriver` creates the main driver actor, which manages
--   the evaluation state and produces rendering fragments.
-- - `logServer` creates an actor that accumulates rendering fragments
--   from the driver and broadcasts them to any subscribed clients.
--
-- `FileChanged` messages from the watch file actor may invalidate the
-- current state.  The driver delegates the actual evaluation to a
-- sub-thread so it can remain responsive.
--
-- `watchAndEvalFile` returns the channel by which a client may
-- subscribe by sending a write-only view of its input channel.

-- The externally visible behavior of the main driver loop:
-- - When the source file changes, send the new set of visible node IDs
--   (`updateResultList`) to the `PChan RFragment`
-- - When a new source block is discovered, assign an ID to it and send
--   the association of that block with that ID (`makeNewBlockId`)
-- - When a source block is successfully evaluated, associate the result
--   with its ID and send that (inside `evalBlock`)

-- Internally, we implement this behavior with a driver thread that
-- forks a worker thread.  Why two threads?  So the driver can notice
-- if a source block in progress has disappeared from the file and
-- kill the worker when that happens.

-- The worker communicates with the driver by sending a "work
-- complete" message.  Note that a worker due to be killed may send a
-- "work complete" message before the driver actually kills it.  If a
-- "file changed" message arrived in the interim, the TopState the
-- worker delivers remains valid to enter into the cache, but should
-- not change the driver's then-current TopState.

-- For this reason, the WorkComplete message contains the ids of the
-- TopStateEx and SourceBlock that the woker evaluated.
