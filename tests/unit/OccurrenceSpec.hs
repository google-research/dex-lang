-- === TODO Property-based testing ===
--
-- The Occurrence data structures should obey some invariants:
-- - Each MaxPlus instance should obey the Semigroup laws (except
--   annihilation)
-- - max(answer(a), answer(b)) == answer(max(a, b))
-- - sum(answer(a), answer(b)) >= answer(sum(a, b))
--
-- These would be good targets for property-based testing.  The open
-- issue is generating well-typed synthetic Access, Use, or
-- CollapsedUse terms.
--
-- One way to do that would be to
-- - Generate a type for a binding -- an array, indexed by a product
--   or sum-typed index, with given elements or alternatives, etc.
-- - Generate an Access for a binding of that type
--   - Generate some free index names
--   - When generating a `for`, generate a new index name
--   - When generating a Location, generate expressions according
--     to the binding's type
--
-- Issue: What type to make the generated iteration-space binders?
-- Make something up and hope expressions become possible?  Reuse
-- (parts of) the type of the binding?  Make a type variable and infer
-- it based on leaf Location expressions?
